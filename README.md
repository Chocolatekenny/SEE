A simple and fun Python calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations on two numbers with a touch of humor! 😄

- **Fun Comments** to keep you smiling while coding 😊

## How to Use 🚀

1. Run the Python script in your terminal or IDE.
2. Enter the first number when prompted.
3. Enter the second number when prompted.
4. Voilà! The calculator will display:
   - Sum of the numbers
   - Difference between the numbers
